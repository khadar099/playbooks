1. Playbook Basics:
yaml
Copy
---
- name: Install Java and Maven
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
name: This is just a description of the playbook. In this case, it's saying that the playbook will install Java and Maven.

hosts: webservers: This specifies the group of hosts where the playbook will run. The group webservers is defined in your Ansible inventory, which could be a list of IPs or hostnames of machines you want to run these tasks on.

become: yes: This indicates that the tasks in this playbook should be executed with elevated (sudo) privileges. This is necessary because installing software like Java and Maven usually requires administrator rights.

2. Installing OpenJDK 11
yaml
Copy
- name: Install Java (OpenJDK 11)
  apt:
    name: openjdk-11-jdk
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
name: The task name, which is "Install Java (OpenJDK 11)".

apt: This module is used to manage packages on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu).

name: openjdk-11-jdk: This specifies the package name to install, which is openjdk-11-jdk (this is the OpenJDK 11 package).

state: present: This ensures that the package is installed. If it's already installed, it won't do anything; if not, it will install it.

update_cache: yes: This tells Ansible to update the local package cache before trying to install the package. It's like running apt update on the command line.

3. Verifying Java Installation
yaml
Copy
- name: Verify Java installation
  command: java -version
  register: java_version
  ignore_errors: yes
name: The task name is "Verify Java installation".

command: java -version: This runs the command java -version on the target host to check if Java is properly installed and to display its version.

register: java_version: This saves the output of the command to a variable called java_version. You can then use this variable later in the playbook.

ignore_errors: yes: This tells Ansible to continue executing the playbook even if this task fails. For example, if Java is not installed properly, it will still proceed to the next task.

4. Display Java Version
yaml
Copy
- name: Display Java version
  debug:
    msg: "Java version installed: {{ java_version.stdout }}"
name: The task name is "Display Java version".

debug: This module prints the value of a variable or expression to the Ansible output.

msg: "Java version installed: {{ java_version.stdout }}": This will display the version of Java that was installed. The {{ java_version.stdout }} syntax is how you access the standard output from the previous java -version command, which was saved in the java_version variable.

5. Installing Maven
yaml
Copy
- name: Install Maven
  apt:
    name: maven
    state: present
name: The task name is "Install Maven".

apt: Again, using the apt package manager to install Maven.

name: maven: This is the name of the package to install, which is simply maven.

state: present: Ensures Maven is installed on the host.

6. Verifying Maven Installation
yaml
Copy
- name: Verify Maven installation
  command: mvn -v
  register: maven_version
  ignore_errors: yes
name: The task name is "Verify Maven installation".

command: mvn -v: This runs the mvn -v command on the target host to verify Maven installation and show the version.

register: maven_version: This saves the output of the mvn -v command in the variable maven_version.

ignore_errors: yes: This ensures that the playbook continues even if the mvn command fails.

7. Display Maven Version
yaml
Copy
- name: Display Maven version
  debug:
    msg: "Maven version installed: {{ maven_version.stdout }}"
name: The task name is "Display Maven version".

debug: This prints out the value of maven_version.stdout (which is the output of the mvn -v command) to show the installed Maven version.
